- Dental caries detection holds the key to unlocking brighter smiles and healthier lives by identifying one of the 
most common oral health issues early on. This vital topic sheds light on innovative ways to combat tooth decay, 
empowering individuals to take control of their oral health and maintain radiant smiles. This research paper delves 
into the realm of transfer learning techniques, aiming to elevate the precision and efficacy of dental caries 
diagnosis. Utilizing Keras ImageDataGenerator, a rich and balanced dataset is crafted by augmenting teeth images 
from the Kaggle teeth dataset. Five cutting-edge pre-trained architectures are harnessed in the transfer learning 
approach: EfficientNetV2B3, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and ResNet50, with each model, initialized 
using ImageNet weights and tailored top layers. A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, encompassing 
accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and false negative rates are employed to gauge the 
performance of these architectures. The findings unveil the unique advantages and drawbacks of each model, 
illuminating the path to the optimal choice for dental caries detection using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class 
Activation Mapping). The training accuracies achieved by EfficientNetV2B3, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, 
Xception, and ResNet50 models stand at 95.89%, 96.58%, 93.15%, 93.15%, and 94.18%, respectively. 
Capitalizing on transfer learning and juxtaposing diverse pre-trained architectures, this research paper paves the 
way for substantial advancements in dental diagnostic capabilities, culminating in enhanced patient outcomes and 
superior oral health.
